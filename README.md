Paragraph on Mountain:
Mountains are one of nature’s most magnificent creations. They rise high above the earth and are often covered with snow at their peaks. The slopes of mountains are home to many plants, animals, and flowing streams that add to their beauty. Mountains play an important role in our lives, as they are the main sources of many rivers. The cool and peaceful environment of the mountains brings calmness to the mind, and activities like trekking and climbing make them a favorite place for adventure lovers. Thus, mountains are a precious gift of nature that make our planet more beautiful and unique.
